# Ängler-Studios

Welcome to Ängler-Studios — a small, passionate indie studio dedicated to crafting immersive, story-driven games with heart and polish.

## Who we are
We are a tight-knit team of designers, programmers, artists, and sound designers who love making memorable experiences. Our focus is on meaningful player choices, atmospheric worlds, and accessible gameplay that invites players to explore and feel.

## What we make
- Narrative-driven adventures with strong worldbuilding
- Imersive 3d games
- Tools and prototypes for rapid iteration and community-driven jams

Current highlights:
- Tidebound (working title) — a sea-bound exploration game about discovery and community.
- Experimental tech and open-source tools to speed development and empower creators.

## Our values
- Player-first design: fun, fairness, and accessibility guide our choices.
- Iteration & craft: we polish systems until they sing.
- Community & collaboration: we learn from players and makers alike.
- Sustainability: healthy working practices and small, sustainable scopes.

## Tech & platforms
We primarily build with Unity and Godot, use C# and C++ where appropriate, and ship across PC and consoles where it fits the game. We also maintain small open-source tools for level editing and workflow automation.
